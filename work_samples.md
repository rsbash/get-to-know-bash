## Writing Samples

I've collected a series of my best technical documentation, API docs, and blogs for review.

1. [See how I transformed Cogility's docs from a monolithic PDF into accessible, feature-first documentation.](#cogility-docs)
2. [Check out Cogynt's Sample Project Library, where my work reduced onboarding from months to weeks.](#cogility-sample-projects)
3. [See how I took Uptime.com's documentation from engineer-driven to user relatable](#uptimecom-docs)
4. [My work on Uptime.com's blog tripled its traffic and created repeatable, SEO-first blogs with a unified voice and style.](#uptimecom-blogs)
5. [I've written a number of evergreen examples of API and software documentation and collected them here.](#evergreen)

### Published and Public

I have archived each of these samples to preserve my work, but each sample should still be publicly accessible from their respective sources. 

#### Cogility Docs

![Object Details Viewer](assets\images\Object-details-viewer-widget.png)

Before I came to Cogility, docs were:

  * **Monolithic and difficult** to skim and search
  * **Important technical detail** was **buried in marketing language**

After my work on [docs.cogility.com](https://docs.cogility.com). Docs became:

  * Tagged with keywords and **easy to search**
  * **Written in simple English** with useful functions taking priority
  * **Styled according to Microsoft's Style guide** and our in-house rules and branding
  * See some selected samples below: 
    * [Advanced Mapping Guide for Advanced Report Builder](cogynt_docs/Advanced_Mapping_Guide_Cogynt.pdf) 
      * Describes each function in detail, including what each call returns.
      * Includes technical instruction, tables showing requests and sample responses, links to downloadable example templates.

  * Featured **tiered projects** to **onboard every level of user**, from beginner to advanced.
  * Used real-world data and practical ideas.
  * Directly correlated to a **15% increase in feature adoption** and a **30% bump in new model creation**. 
  * See samples:

  * Written by engineers for engineers. **Overly technical** and **lacking in instruction**.
  * **Lacking image and video content**, making them **difficult to browse and read**.
