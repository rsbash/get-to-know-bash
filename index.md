![Richard Bashara, Technical Writer](./assets/images/me.jpg){: .profile-circle }

Hello! My name is Richard Bashara, and I'd like to introduce myself. 

I'm a results-driven professional experienced in delivering expert technical documentation for complex SaaS products. I am adept at translating highly technical concepts—including AI/ML-driven features—into clear and actionable resources to support enterprise IT teams, end users, and partner organizations. 

I thrive in environments that challenge me to learn and educate. I believe product mastery and an understanding of the user experience are critical to excellent technical writing. 

I work in Agile/Scrum environments. I treat my docs like their own products, kicking off documentation lifecycles with key stakeholders, providing detailed specs of work to be done, and a comprehensive path toward regular documentation governance and maintenance. 

My specialties include: 
* Technical Writing 
* Project Management 
* Agile/Scrum 
* Documentation Lifecycle Management 
* Stakeholder Alignment 
* SaaS & AI Product Enablement 
* Process Improvement 
* Enterprise Client Support

I am also community focused. Because I believe a better community starts with choices individuals make, I volunteer for both my local school system and local organizations.

I am ready to put my skills to work for you. Thank you for reading my intro, please find:
