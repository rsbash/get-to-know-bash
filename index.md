# Richard Bashara | Portfolio
### Tech Writer & Knowledge Management 

![Richard Bashara, Technical Writer](./assets/images/me.jpg){: .profile-circle }

My name is Richard, and I'm a creator at heart. I've written several manuals for SaaS and AI/ML enabled products that empower IT teams, end users, and my corporate partners to build great things. I thrive in environments where I am challenged with learning to educate, and am drawn to positions requiring technical writing, subject matter expertise, and product mastery.  

I work in Agile/Scrum environments. I treat my docs like their own products, kicking off documentation lifecycles with key stakeholders, providing detailed specs of work to be done, and a comprehensive path toward regular documentation governance and maintenance. 

My specialties include: 

* Technical Writing & Documentation Lifecycles
* Product-Focused Content Strategies
* Agile/Scrum & Process Management
* Documentation Lifecycle Management 
* Stakeholder and Enterprise Client Enablement 

Beyond the office, I am community focused. Because I believe I can directly improve my community through action, I volunteer for both my local school system and local organizations.

I am ready to write concise, actionable documentation for your organization to onboard its users with clarity and measured impact.
