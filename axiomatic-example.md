# Using the Digital Compass from Axiomatic

[Back](/work_samples.html)

üìå **Author:**

The Axiomatic compass app, available [via the Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vincentlee.compass), is a high-precision compass designed to provide true magnetic North for navigation. The app also includes access to a map, with location details such as longitude, latitude, and closest street address.

The following tutorial uses the free version of Axiomatic Digital Compass.


## First Time Setup

Tap the **Install** button from the Google Play link mentioned above.

Once installed, tap the **Open** button from the Play Store or locate the Digital Compass icon from your Android Home Screen and tap it to open the application.

First time use will prompt you for calibration.


### Calibrating your Compass

To begin calibration, tap the **Ok** button on the prompt and then follow these steps:

1. Move away from any device or object that may be causing magnetic interference (do not use this application with a magnetic phone case)
2. Hold the device in your hand, screen facing you
3. Wave the device in a figure 8 motion 2-3 times

Once complete, set your device on the flattest surface you can find and you‚Äôre ready for navigation.

## Compass Screen Details

The Compass Screen contains important details, and is used to access the app‚Äôs settings.

1. **Cardinal Directions** - The four main points of the compass: **N**orth, **S**outh, **E**ast, and **W**est.
2. **Gyroscopic precision** - Use the small indicator circle to determine whether your surface is level. The circle will align with the center of the cross when your surface is level.
3. **Azimuth Ring** - Provides compass bearing.
4. **Current Location** - The current heading you are following.
5. **Magnetic Field Strength** - Uses your phone‚Äôs magnetometer to measure the intensity of magnetic fields around you. Excessively high or low values will be color coded yellow, and should be avoided for precise navigation.
6. **Settings Menu** - Access Compass settings and view state of compass sensors.
7. **Magnetic Heading** - Use approximate or precise navigation headings, with easy map access available.

## Using Your Digital Compass

Basic compass functionality is designed to be simple and intuitive:

First set your device on a flat surface, and then point the top of your device in the **Cardinal Direction** for the endpoint of your journey. Travel in the opposite **Cardinal Direction** to leave.

<aside>

üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è If you are hiking North along a relatively straight road, determine North on your compass app. When you stop at your endpoint, determine South on your compass app to return to where you began.

### Using Azimuth with Your Digital Compass

More complex navigation may require use of the app‚Äôs **Azimuth circle**. Here are the basic steps:

- Place your device on a flat surface and point in the direction you plan to travel.
- Note the bearing displayed at the top of the compass app. Travelling in this direction will keep you on your chosen course.

This example shows the user travelling in a bearing headed 108**¬∞** E

- Choose a landmark or object within visible range along your chosen bearing and navigate towards it without looking at your compass.
- When you reach the landmark/object, stop and check your compass to re-determine Azimuth direction. Repeat these steps as needed.

‚ö†Ô∏è The Digital Compass may provide imprecise Azimuth details when held sideways or upside-down.

### Compass Heading

We recommend toggling on the precise **Heading** to display your current location (by street name or area as applicable). Tap the i icon to get details including:

- Your precise latitude and longitude
- An approximation of your address or location
- A map overlay that plots your precise location

Once precise Heading is enabled, you can toggle between **Magnetic Heading** and **True Heading**.

<aside>

‚ö†Ô∏è Using the precise **Magnetic Heading** will require permissions to access your device‚Äôs location.

## Compass Settings

The **Compass Settings menu** is broken up into [**General**](#general-settings) and [**Advanced**](#advanced-settings) settings.

### General Settings

**Show Magnetic Field Strength** will toggle the magnetic field strength readout. You can also force the device to **Keep screen on** as long as this option is toggled.


### Advanced Settings

**Sensor Status** is a measure of your device‚Äôs sensors that may impact navigation. Ideally, all sensors will have a status of **Good.** If Sensor Status dips to **Medium** or **Bad**, try rebooting the device or relocating for less interference.
